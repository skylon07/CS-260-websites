                I had Amy do our wedding pictures, and they came out great!
                We loved how the colors shine and really show how happy we
                were during our special time!

                Amy helped me do my engagement pictures. She was very talented and
                did many pictures for us and they all turned out amazing! We love the
                work that she does and the care she put in to making sure we were
                happy with our results. Amy is amazing and we would want her for
