            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Amy Welter. I've been taking pictures since age 13,
                and I love being a professional photographer!
                I love capturing the essence of beauty for everyone to enjoy.
                And the only thing I love more than taking pictures of nature
                is taking pictures of <em>you</em>!
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Utah Valley University with a degree in Media Communication,
                but my photography story starts back in 2009 when I fell in love with
                taking pictures of the floweres in my backyard.
                Now I've fallen in love with taking pictures of beauty wherever I can find it!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in me helping you save your special moments,
                please get in touch with me. I'd love to capture your moment with you!
            </p>
